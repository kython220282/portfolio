--------------
**Machine Learning(ML)**
- **I:** A subset of AI where computers learn from data without explicit programming, improving performance over time. An example is email spam filters learning to identify unwanted emails through examples.
- **L:** This is when computers learn from lots of examples instead of being told exactly what to do.
-------------
**Deep Learning(DL)**
- **I:** A complex form of ML using neural networks with multiple layers to model intricate patterns in data. For instance, deep learning powers speech recognition in virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa. 
- **L:** A special kind of machine learning where computers learn from data by using many layers, like a brain. It helps computers recognize your voice on phones.
-------------
**Neural Network**
- **I:** A computing system inspired by the human brain’s network of neurons that processes data in layers for pattern recognition. Used in image classification, such as identifying objects in photos. 
- **L:** A computer system that works a bit like our brain and helps computers understand things like pictures or sounds. Like a program recognizing a cat in a photo.
-------------
**Large Language Model (LLM)**
- **I:** AI models trained on vast text data to understand and generate human-like language. ChatGPT is an example of an LLM used for conversational AI. 
- **L:** A big computer program trained on lots of text so it can talk and write like a person. ChatGPT is an example that can chat with you.
-------------
 **Generative AI**
- **I:** AI that creates new content such as images, text, or music based on learned patterns. DALL·E generates images from textual descriptions as a generative AI example. 
- **L:** AI that can make new things like pictures, stories, or music from what it has learned. Like an app that turns words into drawings.
-------------
**Transformer**
- **I:** A neural network architecture designed to process sequential data efficiently, mainly used in language models. It enables models like BERT to understand context in sentences.
- **L:** A smart computer method that helps understand sentences better than older ways. It helps voice assistants understand complex questions.
-------------
**Reinforcement Learning (RL)**
- **I:** AI learns to make decisions by receiving rewards or penalties for actions, improving through trial and error. An example is an AI mastering video games by playing repeatedly. 
- **L:** Computers learn by trying things and getting rewards if they do well, like a game where you get points for good moves.
-------------
**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- **I:** Technology that enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Chatbots use NLP to converse naturally with users.
- **L:** When a computer understands words and sentences like a human to have a conversation. Siri and Alexa use this to talk to you.
-------------
**Supervised Learning**
- **I:** ML technique where models are trained on labeled data containing input-output pairs. Image recognition trained on photos tagged with object names exemplifies this.
- **L:** The computer learns by looking at many examples where the answer is known, like learning to recognize dogs by seeing labeled dog pictures.
-------------
**Unsupervised Learning**
- **I:** ML where models find patterns in unlabeled data without explicit instructions. Clustering customers by buying behavior without prior labels is an example.
- **L:** The computer tries to find patterns in data without answers, like grouping animals by their features without being told their names.
-------------
**Transfer Learning**
- **I:** Reusing a pre-trained model on a new related task to save time and resources. Fine-tuning a model trained on general images to identify medical X-rays.
- **L:** A computer uses what it learned from one job to help with a new, similar job. Like learning to play one video game, then getting better at another.
-------------
**Fine-Tuning**
- **I:** Adjusting a pre-trained model on specific data to improve accuracy for a particular task. Modifying a language model to better understand legal documents.
- **L:** Changing a computer program a little to make it better at one special task. For example, tuning a speech program to understand accents.
-------------
**Tokenization**
- **I:** Breaking text into smaller units like words or subwords for easier processing by AI models. Splitting the sentence “I am AI” into tokens “I”, “am”, and “AI”.
- **L:** Breaking up sentences into small pieces, like words or parts of words, so computers can understand better. Like splitting “I love AI” into “I,” “love,” “AI.”
-------------
**Embedding**
- **I:** Mapping words or items to numerical vectors that capture semantic meaning, aiding AI understanding. Word embeddings let AI know “king” and “queen” are related concepts.
- **L:** Turning words into numbers that show what they mean, so computers can understand relationships. It helps computers know “cat” and “kitten” are similar.
-------------
**Overfitting**
- **I:** When a model learns training data too exactly, failing to generalize to new data. A model that memorizes exam answers may fail on unseen questions.
- **L:** When a computer learns too much from the examples and can't handle new ones well. Like memorizing a test and doing poorly on a new one.
-------------
**Underfitting**
- **I:** When a model is too simple and fails to capture underlying data patterns. Using a linear model to predict complex nonlinear trends can cause underfitting.
- **L:** When a computer is too simple and can't learn well enough, missing important details. Like guessing without really studying.
-------------
**Hyperparameter**
- **I:** External settings that control how an AI model learns, like learning rate or number of layers. Choosing the right hyperparameters improves model performance.
- **L:** Settings that control how a computer learns, like adjusting volume or brightness on your device.
-------------
**Explainable AI (XAI)**
