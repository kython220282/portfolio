## Introduction

MLOps-Boilerplate is an open-source, production-ready machine learning framework designed to accelerate ML development from experimentation to deployment. This project addresses a common challenge in the ML community: setting up production-grade ML projects from scratch is time-consuming and often requires rebuilding the same infrastructure repeatedly.

## Overview

MLOps-Boilerplate provides a complete, battle-tested structure that can be set up in minutes, eliminating the need to rebuild ML infrastructure for every new project.

## Key Features

- **Production-ready ML pipeline**: Complete training, inference, and monitoring workflows
- **Multiple data source connectors**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, S3, Azure Blob Storage, and more
- **Built-in models**: Random Forest, XGBoost with easy extensibility for custom models
- **Experiment tracking**: MLflow integration with hyperparameter tuning using Optuna
- **REST API**: FastAPI-based API with Prometheus monitoring
- **Model monitoring**: Data drift detection and model performance tracking
- **Deployment ready**: Docker containers and CI/CD pipelines included
- **Testing suite**: Comprehensive test coverage for reliability

## Who Should Use This

- **Data Scientists**: Focus on building models instead of infrastructure
- **ML Teams**: Standardize ML project structure across the organization
- **Startups**: Rapid ML prototyping and deployment capabilities
- **Learners**: Understand and implement MLOps best practices

## Motivation

The framework was built to address the repetitive nature of ML project setup. By providing a reusable template that follows industry best practices, it saves data scientists and ML engineers significant time and effort, allowing them to focus on solving business problems rather than building infrastructure.
