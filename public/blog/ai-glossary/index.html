  "articleBody": "Key Terms For each term, we’ll provide:\nI (Interview Definition): A concise, professional explanation suitable for technical interviews. L (Layman Definition): A simple analogy or explanation that a 10-year-old can understand. Artificial Intelligence(AI)\nI: AI is the simulation of human intelligence by machines to perform tasks like learning, reasoning, and decision-making. For example, self-driving cars use AI to navigate and respond to traffic conditions. L: Imagine teaching a robot to think like you and make smart choices—like a friend who learns from you and helps you with homework. Machine Learning(ML)\nI: A subset of AI where computers learn from data without explicit programming, improving performance over time. An example is email spam filters learning to identify unwanted emails through examples. L: This is when computers learn from lots of examples instead of being told exactly what to do. Deep Learning(DL)\nI: A complex form of ML using neural networks with multiple layers to model intricate patterns in data. For instance, deep learning powers speech recognition in virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa. L: A special kind of machine learning where computers learn from data by using many layers, like a brain. It helps computers recognize your voice on phones. Neural Network\nI: A computing system inspired by the human brain’s network of neurons that processes data in layers for pattern recognition. Used in image classification, such as identifying objects in photos. L: A computer system that works a bit like our brain and helps computers understand things like pictures or sounds. Like a program recognizing a cat in a photo. Large Language Model (LLM)\nI: AI models trained on vast text data to understand and generate human-like language. ChatGPT is an example of an LLM used for conversational AI. L: A big computer program trained on lots of text so it can talk and write like a person. ChatGPT is an example that can chat with you. Generative AI\nI: AI that creates new content such as images, text, or music based on learned patterns. DALL·E generates images from textual descriptions as a generative AI example. L: AI that can make new things like pictures, stories, or music from what it has learned. Like an app that turns words into drawings. Transformer\nI: A neural network architecture designed to process sequential data efficiently, mainly used in language models. It enables models like BERT to understand context in sentences. L: A smart computer method that helps understand sentences better than older ways. It helps voice assistants understand complex questions. Reinforcement Learning (RL)\nI: AI learns to make decisions by receiving rewards or penalties for actions, improving through trial and error. An example is an AI mastering video games by playing repeatedly. L: Computers learn by trying things and getting rewards if they do well, like a game where you get points for good moves. Natural Language Processing (NLP)\nI: Technology that enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Chatbots use NLP to converse naturally with users. L: When a computer understands words and sentences like a human to have a conversation. Siri and Alexa use this to talk to you. Supervised Learning\nI: ML technique where models are trained on labeled data containing input-output pairs. Image recognition trained on photos tagged with object names exemplifies this. L: The computer learns by looking at many examples where the answer is known, like learning to recognize dogs by seeing labeled dog pictures. Unsupervised Learning\nI: ML where models find patterns in unlabeled data without explicit instructions. Clustering customers by buying behavior without prior labels is an example. L: The computer tries to find patterns in data without answers, like grouping animals by their features without being told their names. Transfer Learning\nI: Reusing a pre-trained model on a new related task to save time and resources. Fine-tuning a model trained on general images to identify medical X-rays. L: A computer uses what it learned from one job to help with a new, similar job. Like learning to play one video game, then getting better at another. Fine-Tuning\nI: Adjusting a pre-trained model on specific data to improve accuracy for a particular task. Modifying a language model to better understand legal documents. L: Changing a computer program a little to make it better at one special task. For example, tuning a speech program to understand accents. Tokenization\nI: Breaking text into smaller units like words or subwords for easier processing by AI models. Splitting the sentence “I am AI” into tokens “I”, “am”, and “AI”. L: Breaking up sentences into small pieces, like words or parts of words, so computers can understand better. Like splitting “I love AI” into “I,” “love,” “AI.” Embedding\nI: Mapping words or items to numerical vectors that capture semantic meaning, aiding AI understanding. Word embeddings let AI know “king” and “queen” are related concepts. L: Turning words into numbers that show what they mean, so computers can understand relationships. It helps computers know “cat” and “kitten” are similar. Overfitting\nI: When a model learns training data too exactly, failing to generalize to new data. A model that memorizes exam answers may fail on unseen questions. L: When a computer learns too much from the examples and can’t handle new ones well. Like memorizing a test and doing poorly on a new one. Underfitting\nI: When a model is too simple and fails to capture underlying data patterns. Using a linear model to predict complex nonlinear trends can cause underfitting. L: When a computer is too simple and can’t learn well enough, missing important details. Like guessing without really studying. Hyperparameter\nI: External settings that control how an AI model learns, like learning rate or number of layers. Choosing the right hyperparameters improves model performance. L: Settings that control how a computer learns, like adjusting volume or brightness on your device. Explainable AI (XAI)\nI: AI designed to make its decisions understandable to humans for trust and transparency. A credit scoring AI explaining why a loan was approved or denied. L: AI that can explain why it made a decision so people can understand it, like a robot telling you why it picked a certain game. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)\n**I:**Hypothetical AI with human-level cognitive abilities across many tasks, not just one. AGI would reason and learn as broadly as a person, though it does not yet exist. L: A computer smart enough to do any task people can do, like a really clever robot friend (still only in imagination). Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)\nI: Two neural networks competing, one generating fake data and the other detecting it, improving output realism. GANs create realistic synthetic images used in art and media. L: Two AI models play a game: one makes fake pictures, and the other tries to spot fakes, making the pictures better over time. Chatbot\nI: AI systems designed to simulate conversation with humans through text or speech. Customer support bots help answer queries on websites using chatbot technology. L: A computer program you can talk to that answers questions or helps you, like a virtual assistant on a website. Prompt Engineering\nI: Crafting specific inputs to guide AI into producing desired and accurate outputs. Using tailored prompts to get precise answers from a language model. L: Giving clear and smart instructions to an AI so it gives the best answers, like asking a robot the right question. Synthetic Data\nI: Artificially generated data used for training AI when real data is limited or sensitive. Simulated driving data helps train autonomous vehicle systems. L: Fake data made by computers to help teach AI when real data is hard to get, like drawing practice pictures for a robot. Few-Shot Learning\nI: AI’s ability to learn new tasks with very few examples, reducing data needs. A model recognizing new objects after seeing only a handful of images. L: When an AI can learn a new thing after seeing only a few examples, like learning a new game quickly. Multi-Agent System\nI: Multiple AI agents that interact and collaborate to solve problems or complete tasks. Robotic teams coordinating warehouse logistics exemplify this. L: Many AI “robots” or programs working together to solve a problem, like a team winning a game by helping each other. AI Bias\nI: When AI reflects or amplifies unfair prejudices due to biased data or design, harming fairness. Facial recognition systems misidentifying certain demographic groups highlight AI bias concerns. L: When AI makes unfair decisions because the examples it learned from were unfair, like a robot that doesn’t treat everyone equally. Robotic Process Automation (RPA)\nI: Automating repetitive business tasks using software robots to increase efficiency. Automating invoice processing in finance departments using RPA tools. L: Using computer robots to do boring and repeated office work, like typing data over and over. Conversational AI\nI: AI systems designed for natural dialogue with humans, such as virtual assistants. Alexa and Google Assistant are examples of conversational AI that understand and respond via voice. L: AI that talks and listens to people naturally, like Alexa or Google Assistant helping you with questions. Autonomous AI\nI: AI systems capable of operating independently without human intervention. Self-driving cars navigate and make driving decisions autonomously. L: AI that can work by itself, like a self-driving car that knows where to go without a driver. Last Updated: November 11, 2025\nAuthor: Karan Raj Sharma\n",

<li><strong>I:</strong> Reusing a pre-trained model on a new related task to save time and resources. Fine-tuning a model trained on general images to identify medical X-rays.</li>
<li><strong>L:</strong> A computer uses what it learned from one job to help with a new, similar job. Like learning to play one video game, then getting better at another.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Fine-Tuning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I:</strong> Adjusting a pre-trained model on specific data to improve accuracy for a particular task. Modifying a language model to better understand legal documents.</li>
<li><strong>L:</strong> Changing a computer program a little to make it better at one special task. For example, tuning a speech program to understand accents.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Tokenization</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I:</strong> Breaking text into smaller units like words or subwords for easier processing by AI models. Splitting the sentence “I am AI” into tokens “I”, “am”, and “AI”.</li>
<li><strong>L:</strong> Breaking up sentences into small pieces, like words or parts of words, so computers can understand better. Like splitting “I love AI” into “I,” “love,” “AI.”</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Embedding</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I:</strong> Mapping words or items to numerical vectors that capture semantic meaning, aiding AI understanding. Word embeddings let AI know “king” and “queen” are related concepts.</li>
<li><strong>L:</strong> Turning words into numbers that show what they mean, so computers can understand relationships. It helps computers know “cat” and “kitten” are similar.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Overfitting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I:</strong> When a model learns training data too exactly, failing to generalize to new data. A model that memorizes exam answers may fail on unseen questions.</li>
<li><strong>L:</strong> When a computer learns too much from the examples and can&rsquo;t handle new ones well. Like memorizing a test and doing poorly on a new one.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Underfitting</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I:</strong> When a model is too simple and fails to capture underlying data patterns. Using a linear model to predict complex nonlinear trends can cause underfitting.</li>
<li><strong>L:</strong> When a computer is too simple and can&rsquo;t learn well enough, missing important details. Like guessing without really studying.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Hyperparameter</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I:</strong> External settings that control how an AI model learns, like learning rate or number of layers. Choosing the right hyperparameters improves model performance.</li>
<li><strong>L:</strong> Settings that control how a computer learns, like adjusting volume or brightness on your device.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Explainable AI (XAI)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I:</strong> AI designed to make its decisions understandable to humans for trust and transparency. A credit scoring AI explaining why a loan was approved or denied.</li>
<li><strong>L:</strong> AI that can explain why it made a decision so people can understand it, like a robot telling you why it picked a certain game.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>**I:**Hypothetical AI with human-level cognitive abilities across many tasks, not just one. AGI would reason and learn as broadly as a person, though it does not yet exist.</li>
<li><strong>L:</strong> A computer smart enough to do any task people can do, like a really clever robot friend (still only in imagination).</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I:</strong> Two neural networks competing, one generating fake data and the other detecting it, improving output realism. GANs create realistic synthetic images used in art and media.</li>
<li><strong>L:</strong> Two AI models play a game: one makes fake pictures, and the other tries to spot fakes, making the pictures better over time.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Chatbot</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I:</strong> AI systems designed to simulate conversation with humans through text or speech. Customer support bots help answer queries on websites using chatbot technology.</li>
<li><strong>L:</strong> A computer program you can talk to that answers questions or helps you, like a virtual assistant on a website.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Prompt Engineering</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I:</strong> Crafting specific inputs to guide AI into producing desired and accurate outputs. Using tailored prompts to get precise answers from a language model.</li>
<li><strong>L:</strong> Giving clear and smart instructions to an AI so it gives the best answers, like asking a robot the right question.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Synthetic Data</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I:</strong> Artificially generated data used for training AI when real data is limited or sensitive. Simulated driving data helps train autonomous vehicle systems.</li>
<li><strong>L:</strong> Fake data made by computers to help teach AI when real data is hard to get, like drawing practice pictures for a robot.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Few-Shot Learning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I:</strong> AI’s ability to learn new tasks with very few examples, reducing data needs. A model recognizing new objects after seeing only a handful of images.</li>
<li><strong>L:</strong> When an AI can learn a new thing after seeing only a few examples, like learning a new game quickly.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Multi-Agent System</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I:</strong> Multiple AI agents that interact and collaborate to solve problems or complete tasks. Robotic teams coordinating warehouse logistics exemplify this.</li>
<li><strong>L:</strong> Many AI “robots” or programs working together to solve a problem, like a team winning a game by helping each other.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>AI Bias</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I:</strong> When AI reflects or amplifies unfair prejudices due to biased data or design, harming fairness. Facial recognition systems misidentifying certain demographic groups highlight AI bias concerns.</li>
<li><strong>L:</strong> When AI makes unfair decisions because the examples it learned from were unfair, like a robot that doesn’t treat everyone equally.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Robotic Process Automation (RPA)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I:</strong> Automating repetitive business tasks using software robots to increase efficiency. Automating invoice processing in finance departments using RPA tools.</li>
<li><strong>L:</strong> Using computer robots to do boring and repeated office work, like typing data over and over.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Conversational AI</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I:</strong> AI systems designed for natural dialogue with humans, such as virtual assistants. Alexa and Google Assistant are examples of conversational AI that understand and respond via voice.</li>
<li><strong>L:</strong> AI that talks and listens to people naturally, like Alexa or Google Assistant helping you with questions.</li>
