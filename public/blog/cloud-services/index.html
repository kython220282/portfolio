  "articleBody": " The Ultimate Cloud Services Cheat Sheet: AWS, GCP, Azure Compared Introduction: Building Agentic AI in the Multi-Cloud Era Welcome to 2026, where agentic AI systems—autonomous agents that can reason, plan, use tools, and execute complex multi-step workflows—are no longer science fiction. They’re powering customer service, automating data analysis, orchestrating business processes, and even writing code.\nBut here’s the challenge: building production-ready AI agents requires the right cloud infrastructure. Whether you’re implementing:\n🤖 Customer service agents with RAG capabilities 📊 Data analysis agents that query databases and generate insights 🔧 DevOps agents that monitor systems and take corrective actions 💼 Business process agents that coordinate across multiple tools You need to understand which cloud services to use and how they map across AWS, GCP, and Azure.\nThis guide solves that problem. We’ll compare 25+ core services across all three cloud providers, but with a twist: every service is explained through the lens of building agentic AI systems.\nWhat You’ll Learn: ✅ Side-by-side comparison of AWS, GCP, and Azure services\n✅ How each service powers different components of AI agents\n✅ When to use each cloud provider for AI workloads\n✅ Cost optimization strategies for agent

<p>Welcome to 2026, where <strong>agentic AI systems</strong>—autonomous agents that can reason, plan, use tools, and execute complex multi-step workflows—are no longer science fiction. They&rsquo;re powering customer service, automating data analysis, orchestrating business processes, and even writing code.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the challenge: <strong>building production-ready AI agents requires the right cloud infrastructure</strong>. Whether you&rsquo;re implementing:</p>
<ul>
<li>🤖 <strong>Customer service agents</strong> with RAG capabilities</li>
<li>📊 <strong>Data analysis agents</strong> that query databases and generate insights</li>
<li>🔧 <strong>DevOps agents</strong> that monitor systems and take corrective actions</li>
<li>💼 <strong>Business process agents</strong> that coordinate across multiple tools</li>
</ul>
<p>You need to understand which cloud services to use and how they map across AWS, GCP, and Azure.</p>
<p><strong>This guide solves that problem.</strong> We&rsquo;ll compare 25+ core services across all three cloud providers, but with a twist: <strong>every service is explained through the lens of building agentic AI systems.</strong></p>

✅ When to use each cloud provider for AI workloads<br>

<p><strong>Winner</strong>: GCP (marginally cheaper), but differences are minimal.</p>
<p><strong>Real Cost Driver</strong>: LLM token usage (80% of costs). Optimize with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Response caching (ElastiCache/Memorystore)</li>
<li>Prompt compression techniques</li>
<li>Model selection (smaller models when possible)</li>
<li>Request batching</li>
