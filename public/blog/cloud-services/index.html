<p>Agentic AI systems require more than LLM APIs. They require orchestration, memory, vector search, governance, observability, workflow engines, and cost optimization.</p>
<p>This guide compares AWS, GCP, and Azure across <strong>compute, storage, databases, vector systems, orchestration, security, and AI platforms</strong> &mdash; specifically through the lens of building production-grade AI
agents.</p>

<p><strong>Winner</strong>: GCP (marginally cheaper), but differences are minimal.</p>
<p><strong>Real Cost Driver</strong>: LLM token usage (80% of costs). Optimize with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Response caching (ElastiCache/Memorystore)</li>
<li>Prompt compression techniques</li>
<li>Model selection (smaller models when possible)</li>
<li>Request batching</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cost estimates assume:
<ul>
<li>Mid-tier foundation models (e.g., GPT-4o / Claude Sonnet class)</li>
<li>Moderate RAG retrieval</li>
<li>100K interactions/month</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Actual costs vary significantly by model selection and token usage.</li>
<li>LLM token usage typically represents ~70-85% of total cost.</li>
